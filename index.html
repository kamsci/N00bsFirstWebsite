        <h2>Welcome,</h2>
        <p>
          to my very first website.
        </p>
        <p>
          The day I started this site is the day I decided I would embark on a new life path. This represents my first steps into learning many of the dialects of the newest language of a modern age. Which is just a poetic attempt to say:  I decided I will learn to code.
        </p>
        <p>
          So far... Best. Decision. Ever.
        </p>
        <h2>Who's website is this anyway?</h2>
        <p>
          Glad you asked. We can start with the conventional basics.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Name: Krista Calderon</li>
          <li>Professional Occupation: Product Management</li>
          <li>Life Occupation: Experience Enhancement
          <li>Current Home: Central District, Seattle WA</li>
          <li>Hobbies: The kitchen (cooking & baking), Fitness (yoga/hiking/lifting/boxing/others), Exploring (concerts/fests/long walkd in the neighborhood/etc.)
          <li>Values: Community (family/friends/coworkers/my city), Humor (jokes/self-confidence/familiarity), Stick-to-itive-ness (personal drive/dedication)
          <li>Spirit Animal: Just kidding</li>
        <p>
          That being said, I am always looking for the unconventional way to accomplish things, if available. This being my first website and all, I don't have many tools at my disposal, we will keep this simple for now.
