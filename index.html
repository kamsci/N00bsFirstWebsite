        <h2>Welcome,</h2>
        <p>
          to my very first website.
        </p>
        <p>
          The day I started this site is the day I decided I would embark on a new life path. This represents my first steps into learning many of the dialects of the newest language of a modern age. Which is just a poetic attempt to say:  I decided I will learn to code.
        </p>
        <p>
          So far... Best. Decision. Ever.
        </p>
        <h2>Who's website is this anyway?</h2>
        <p>
          Glad you asked. We can start with the conventional basics.
        </p>

          That being said, I am always looking for the unconventional way to do things. For a list of personality traits, please visit the 'Layers' page.
