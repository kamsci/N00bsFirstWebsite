        <h2>Welcome, </h2>
        <p>
          ...to my very first website.
        </p>
        <p>
          The day I started this site is the day I decided I would embark on a new life path. This represents my first steps into learning many of the dialects of the newest language of a modern age. Which is just a poetic attempt to say:  I decided I will learn to code.
        </p>
        <p>
          So far... Best. Decision. Ever.
        </p>

        <p>
          I love the challenges that building something brings. I love identifying each piece of code and figuring out what it can do and how it will conribute to my vision. I even love that I kicked butt in Algebra in school and now I get to see and use functions again!
